Predicate
=========

**Alpha: Do NOT use for production code!** 

A predicate is a function that returns `true` or `false` based on the value passed to it.

Package Predicate defines the Predicate interface and the PredicateFunc, as well as several basic predicates. It also
 provides a means to unmarshal predicates from a JSON string.
